The listings encompass a variety of models from different manufacturers, each extracted from the model name. Vehicle conditions range from 'fair' to 'like new' and 'excellent,' indicating the quality and maintenance level of the cars. The dataset also includes critical information such as the odometer readings, which reflect the mileage of the vehicles, and the days listed, showing how long each vehicle has been on the market. The transmission types are all automatic in this sample, and vehicle types include SUVs, pickups, and sedans. This comprehensive set of attributes allows for a detailed analysis of factors influencing vehicle listings and their market dynamics.")
