# Vehicle Advertisement Data Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize a dataset containing vehicle advertisements to gain insights into pricing trends, condition impacts, and manufacturer preferences. The analysis is presented through an interactive web application built using Streamlit and Plotly Express libraries in Python.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration includes summarizing dataset statistics, examining the distribution of days listed, and understanding price variations based on vehicle condition and manufacturer.
  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilizing Plotly Express, the dashboard features histograms, box plots, and bar charts. Users can interact with these visualizations to explore data insights dynamically.

- **Detailed Analysis:** For deeper insights, detailed views allow users to compare average prices across vehicle models and manufacturers, facilitating informed decisions based on data-driven findings.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

2. **Install Dependencies:**
Make sure you have Python installed. Then create and activate a virtual environment, and install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Application:**
streamlit run app.py
This command will launch the Streamlit web application locally. Open your web browser and go to the provided localhost URL.

## Usage

Once the Streamlit application is running, you will see various interactive components:
- Explore the dataset summary and initial insights.
- Use checkboxes to toggle between different visualizations and detailed views.
- Analyze trends in vehicle prices based on condition, manufacturer, and model year.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to leverage Python for data analysis and visualization using Streamlit and Plotly Express. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and understand vehicle advertisement data effectively.
